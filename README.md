## Summary

- 1 player -> farmer (PC)
- x players -> magpies (Phones)
- magpies' goal -> steal every item from the farm and collect them all in the nest
- farmer's goal -> find the nest
- magpies don't use any weapon, they can just grab and ungrab the items
- farmer can throw their flipflops (or ball) to hit the magpies. he has x2 at a time, and he has to collect the thrown ones in order to throw them again. When a magpie is hit, it can be disoriented or stunned for a specific amount of time (30 secs?)
- optional: can be point based, so magpies' team wins when (50?) points are collected. Each object counts for a different amount of points.
